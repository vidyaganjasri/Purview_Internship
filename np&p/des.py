NumPy in a Nutshell:
Purpose: Used for fast, efficient calculations with large datasets.

Key Applications:
Machine Learning (e.g., stock prediction models)
Image Processing (working with 2D or 3D arrays like images)

Why NumPy:
Traditional Python lists are slow and inefficient when working with large volumes of data.
NumPy arrays are much faster and memory-efficient because they are designed for numerical and scientific computing.

Pandas in a Nutshell:
Purpose: Built on top of NumPy, Pandas is for data analysis.

Key Applications:
Working with structured/tabular data (like data in Excel, CSV files, or databases).
Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, handling duplicates.
Data Manipulation: Summarizing, filtering, and grouping data.

Why Pandas:
While NumPy is focused on calculations and mathematical operations, Pandas excels in data analysis tasks.
It internally uses NumPy to handle computations but provides easy-to-use structures like DataFrames for handling and analyzing structured data.
